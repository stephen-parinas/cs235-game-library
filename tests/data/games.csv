The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/header.jpg?t=1657631096,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw9/?lang=us,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,44,5946,,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together",Action,"Action,Hack and Slash,Open World,Historical,Musou,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Anime,Co-op,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,RPG,Adventure,Beat 'em up,Online Co-Op,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_6a9749773b19bfc532f8a716004f3d333fb4b868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_bc3f18711562cbdb594526f7b1ecfad88b8fa838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_1071b4f997bb7ddd97283fc3dc05ec145f08c11c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_750a13c069c1c0d9a5f41a447b6622d2057030d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_00cd4e157cd424983b23a0d48640aea9f3fac779.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_c198c86da8f96a5980b9bbf215045f8f41b28ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768983/movie_max.mp4?t=1576123907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708706/movie_max.mp4?t=1518509272"

Lost Planet 2 is the sequel to Lost Planet™: Extreme Condition, the landmark third-person shooter which debuted on Xbox 360 and went on to sell over 2.3 million units worldwide after its release. Lost Planet 2 offers deeper insight into the world of E.D.N III and the uncertain fate of future mankind. Already acclaimed for its visual accomplishments from the console versions, Lost Planet 2 will define the 3D experience on the PC. Stunning environments will immerse the player in NVIDIA Vision Surround technology, and the rebalanced gameplay and streamlined control mechanics make Lost Planet 2 PC the ultimate Lost Planet experience. A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Mankind has engaged in a civil war to take control of the precious Thermal Energy that powers weapons and vehicles on E.D.N. III and resulted in a separation into various factions. Players will control heroes from each faction across 6 interconnected episodes, viewing the war from the perspective of each, creating a truly unique interactive experience. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players’ perspectives.

The grappling hooks that made the gameplay in Lost Planet a true 3-D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by moving to elevated locations quickly. Lost Planet 2’s biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are VS that transform into other vehicles, hold up to three players and some that even take multiple players to operate.
